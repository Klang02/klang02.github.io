                            <h3 class="about">Meet Kate DeLange</h3>
                            <p>She bakes sweets that define special moments in our lives. If you asked Kate where her passion began, she would say it all started when she was very young. ‘When I was a little girl the house always had the aromas of freshly baked pies, cakes, and cookies.’ Born from a long line of home bakers, one could almost call it destiny. She went to college full-time and worked several jobs to help pay for her education. After all the studying she discovered baking was a great stress relief! Having a passion for baking and then turning it into a business is a dream come true. “There's no better feeling in the world than sharing something I love with others.”</p>
